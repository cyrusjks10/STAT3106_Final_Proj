# STAT3106_Final_Proj

## Goal

This project examines the episode scripts of the tv series Star Wars the Clone Wars, in attempt to uncover insights about viewers preference for the tv series. I utilize lasso regression, multiple regression, and clustering to predict an episode's ratings, given the terms present in an episode's script. The models usggested that terms the indicated action and characters that were clone troopers and jedi had a positive effect on ratings. Though giving the qualtiy of the data, it is hard to make generalizations.
