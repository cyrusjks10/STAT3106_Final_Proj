No I only...Let me tell you something Senator.I have led our peoplesince before you were born.Ive seen a hundred planetsrise and fall through force of arms.If its not the Separatists out therethen its a malevolent and aggressiveenemy nonethelessand I will not let whoever it isjeopardize the securityof the people of Pantora.But if the Jedi discoverthat the Separatists arent behind thisthen perhaps there isa peaceful resolution.Senator I am willing to fight and diefor my people.Its time to ask yourselfif you are brave enough to do the same.Theres some kind of reflection up there.Do you see itYep.Well they know were coming. Lets go.Steady Anakin. Theyre only curious.Lets not provoke them as the droidsand our troops must have done.Too bad we didnt bring Threepio along.How do you plan on communicatingwith these thingsPatience.Maybe theyre smarter than we are.Well Say something.Just shut up.We come to you in peace.We will not bring harm.Peace.Right.Glad you made it back sir.Its getting nasty out there.You dont know the half of it.What did you findIt seems weve stumbled ontoan inhabited planet.Impossible.Our explorers have spent much time hereover the long history of Pantora.No one lives here. Theyre trespassers.With respect Chairman Chothese creatures the Talzarent advanced enoughto master space travel.I think they may have been herelonger than Pantora.Whoever they are they belong to us.This whole system belongs to us.Your Majesty if there are life forms herethen the Senate must decide jurisdiction.They are savages.Look at what theyve done.Theyve slaughtered your troops.They only want to be left alone.The droids attacked themand Im afraid our outpostgot caught in the middle.They must be subdued. Theyre dangerous.Captain Rexprepare your troops for battle.We promised their chiefthere would be no retaliation.Weve arranged a meetingbetween their high counciland you and the Senator.They want peace.We cant send troopers.Theyll think we lied.These creaturesare little more than animals.You cant lie to an animal.They cant be trusted.But Your Majesty...NoIt is obviousthese creatures are not coveredby the Convention of Civilized Systems.The Jedi Council has no say in the matter.If the Jedi are ableto communicate with themtheir status is in doubt.Do you standagainst your Chairman SenatorOf course not Your Majesty.If we are going to meet with ThiSenand his council at the arranged timewe will have to leave now.Sir the gunships cant take offin this storm.We dont have enough bikesfor the entire platoon.Have the rest of the men standby here.No matter what the Chairman thinkswere not going to war.Captain Put your men on that ice ridge.We will attackas soon as the savages arrive.There will be no attack Chairman.You will do as I commandThis planet is under my jurisdictionNothing is under your control Chairman.The Talz are already here.Their scouts have been following usfor some time.It seems ThiSen doesnt trust youany more than you trust him.Rex tell your men to stand down.Stay hereand dont do anything to provoke them.Yes sir.Your Highness.We have returnedas promised.These savages have no rights here.Chieftain ThiSen welcomes youto his home and hopes you come in peace.He wishes to be good neighborsbut he does not wish youto remain on his planet.Listen droid translate everything I sayand exactly as I say it.Would you like me to represent Pantorain this matterNot on your life Senator.There will be no diplomacy this time.Listen here you savage.This world belongsto the moon of Pantoraand as the Supreme Chairmanand Exalted Ruler of Pantorayou will not command meto leave this planetor do anything else.Your Majesty we cant.Droid Tell him.Oh dear.I recommenda less confrontational discussion.The Talz are easily provoked.That didnt go over very well.Chairman I promised the Talzthat we would leave them in peace.This is now an internal affair of Pantora.The great ThiSen Son of Sunsasks again that you leaveor it will mean war.Then war it is.Troopers mount up and follow me.Whats up GeneralYoure going to have to staywith the Chairmanuntil we can work things out.Protect him at all costs.Mount up Were moving outSenator you knowa preemptive strike is illegal.Isnt there anything you can do to stop itIm afraid not.He has proclaimed this conflictan internal affair.You could petition the Jedi Councilfor an intervention.You mean without his authorizationThere must be someone on your moonwho could approve it.The Speaker of the Assembly.He has the power.Lets get back to the base.The storm is letting up.Maybe we can get a transmission through.Here they are Fire when youre in rangeSir with all due respectwere only here to protect you.AmbushIts a trap Kill themWere surrounded. Defensive formationChairman get downWeve got to hold outFall back First squad cover the retreatRetreatWe cant retreat from these animalsSavages.The Assembly has decided that the actionsof Chairman Cho are out of order.Senator Chuchi youre given the authorityto negotiate a peaceful settlementbetween the sovereign planet of Pantoraand the Talz.It is decided then.Pilot lets get moving.Here they comeSenator now that you have the authorityhow do you plan on making peacewith the TalzActually Master Jedisince you are far more experiencedI was hoping you could negotiateon Pantoras behalf.Im afraid thats not possible Senator.But I dont understand.The Jedi serve the Senate.I must order you...Senatorit is your people the Talz are at war with.If the violence is to stopit is you who must represent your people.Good to see you sir.You okay RexIts just a scratch.Whats going onWere in quite a mess sir. Eleven deadthe rest wounded including the Chairman.Chairman can you hear meSenator. Good.You must avenge me.As my final commandas Chairman of PantoraI order you to destroy the Talz.Im afraid I cannot do that Chairman.The Pantoran Assemblyhas called you out of order.I am to negotiate peace.No. ImpossiblePeace NeverI died for our people.Senator now is the time.Protocol droid come with me.Threepio get going.Yes Master Ani.Droid translate for me.Yes Mistress.To die for ones people is a great sacrifice.To live for ones peoplean even greater sacrifice.I choose to live for my people.What do you chooseHe chooses to live as well.We will leave Orto Plutoniaunder the watchful eyes of the Talzfrom this day forthand recognize your sovereigntyas a free and equal people.Well done Senator.Yes. Most impressive.Thank you Master Jedi.Now that you have created peacebetween your people and the Talzremember one crucial thing.Yes Master KenobiMake it last Senator.Make it last.And be an example to othersso not only this war but every war wagedmay come to an end as well.I will.

I shall tell Mistress... Anakin\n\n\n That will be all Threepio. Are you sure my lady Yes Threepio. Now go. Oh. Very well. I brought dinner.

I wish it could always be just like this. Me too. I have to report to the Jedi Council. Right nowActually about seven clicks ago.If I keep delaying ObiWan will senda clone squad out to find me.Ive been ducking his signals all night.I understand. I can sense that youre angry. Dont think you can read my mind.Padm you shouldnt take this personally.Duty comes first especially in wartime.Sorry Im late. Whats going onWe believe Senator Clovisis conspiring with the Separatists.We need to find out what hes planning.Do you want meto interrogate him MasterNo. Treat Senator Clovis as a criminalwe should not.The slightest misstep could causea major incident.You feel if we provoke himwell never find out what hes up to.Exactly. We need someone who is nota Jedi to get close to him for us.Someone he wont suspect. If not a Jedi who A fellow Senator.Selected Senator Amidala we have.You want her to spy on ClovisI dont think thats a good idea.There has to be someone elsewhos more qualified for this.We chose Senator Amidalabecause she and Clovisentered the Senate in the same year.They served on the same committees.They were good friends. I didnt know that.Personal matters for the Senatorthese are. Know them why would youIts just thatI wouldnt expect Senator Amidalato have a friend in the Banking Clan.Master Yoda has already asked herto spy on Clovis for us and she refused.Trust you she does Skywalker.That is why convince her you must.Yes Master. Senator Amidala. General Skywalker.You finally found some time for me. Are you still mad about last night Why would I be mad Im not mad.Good.

Its verydifferent from spying on a traitor.You mean I cant handle the mission.I meanIm not gonna let you do it.Youre not going to let meIts not your decision to make. Its mine.Lucky for usyouve already decided to refuse.Actually I just changed my mind.Youve convinced me that its vitalto learn what Clovis is doing. I accept the mission to spy on him. Even though Im telling you not to.Dont take it personally Anakin.Duty comes first especially in wartime.First Ill needto get back in touch with him.Clovis and I havent spoken in a long time.A surprise that is given your past.

No. No its okay. I understand.Im the Padawan youre the Master.Good day General.Skywalkers waiting for you. At it again are they Again MasterLets just say that they have a penchantfor playing loose with regulations and rules of command. Yeah but when I say it they actually listen to me.

Dont tempt me Snips.If youre both finishedwith your little discussionwe do have a factory to destroy.Well BarrissArent you going to introduce yourselfPadawan learner Barriss Offeeat your service.Glad to meet you. Im Ahsoka.Its good to see both of you again.I wish it wasunder more peaceful circumstances.A frontal assault is risky.Our losses will be high.But not as high as theyll beif that factory comes online.Indeed but there is an alternative.Every Geonosian building has a seriesof catacombs beneath itthat run deep underground.Some of the tunnels are close enoughto this cliff wallso that you could cut a holeand make an entry point.Once insidewe could find the main reactorplant the explosivesand blow the factory inside out.Well looks like a good way to get lostif you ask me.For the unprepared perhaps.But I have instructed Barriss to memorizethe labyrinth all number number number  junctions.You always were thorough.It pays for one to be prepared.Right BarrissEspecially when other peoples livesdepend on your success.How do we keep the Geonosians occupiedwhile someone else is setting the bombsGood point Snips.

Three two onemark.Lets get going. After you Barriss.You feel Ahsoka is not up to the task I never said that. What is it thenNothing. Lets prepare the men.Well have to make a bold moveif were to draw them out of the factoryand keep their attention on usand not the Padawans.The best way to do that is tomarch our troops straight up the middleparade style. They cant resist that. With no cover Well we have to make it tempting.The factory is operatingat number number  production capacity.We have number number  garrisons of new droidsready to deploy.No the Super Tanks are not readybut when they arethe Republic forces will be routed.They have no weaponthat can penetrate its heavy armor.Here come the droids. Everybody steady.Steady. Keep marching.I hope the Padawans have made itpast the bridge by now. That looks like a lot of droids. Well it is a droid factory.As long as we can destroy themfaster than they can make themwell come out on top.I loveyour simple logic Skywalker.Here we goLet them fall into the trap.You may now commence attack.

You found the Death Watch armies then Yes sir. They are preparing for battle.But if they attackit would strengthen the peoples resolvenot to join the Death Watch movement.The Death Watch will never bestrong enough to take over Mandalorewithout the will of the people.Not if the Republichas a military presence here.Their occupation will turn the Death Watchfrom terrorists to liberatorsin the eyes of the people.But how can we stop the Republicfrom coming hereOur fate now lies in the handsof Duchess Satine.\n\n\nIt grieves me to say it but Death Watchis now a significant deadly threat.Mandalore is making great strides to findthe leaders of this terrorist movement.They are not powerful enoughto destabilize our government.We will resolve this without conflict.If the Republic gets involved in our affairsit will only lead to further violence.Thus I shall reassert our positionof neutrality. Talk of an idealist. No those are the words of a pacifistand a peoplewho have chosen nonviolent action.That may be so Duchess.However this message was deliveredto my staff just this morning.I think you shall findit most illuminating.The actions by our governmenthave taken us into a period of civil war.To acknowledge itwould be to invite panic in the streets. Duchess do you know this man And so we hid the truth from our people.Yes. Deputy Minister Jerec.Hes a dear friend.It is more than mere possibilitymore than eventuality. It is here. StopDeputy Minister Jerecis an honorable man.He would never commit such liesto the record.The Mandalorian governmentholds no secrets from its people.If only that were true.Death Watch is far strongerthan we once thought.If we are to combat them effectivelywe must have Republic assistance.Instead this government acts out of prideand rejects the help of the Jedi.Its not true. Its not trueThe Duchess Satinewill ultimately cause our defeat.Make no mistake Republic interventionis absolutely necessary.This isnt right. Something here isnt rightI wish to speak to Jerec immediately.Sadly Deputy Minister Jerecperished this morningin a Death Watch bombing on Kalevala.Let us ensurethat his death was not in vain.Let us commit our military mightto defending the Mandalorian people.Defending You mean to occupy our home.You would trample our rightto selfdetermination.We mean to save your people.You will turn our planetinto a military targetwhich will bring the war to us.Mandalore must remain a neutral system.The vote shall commencein the next session.DuchessSatine wait.I just heard what happened in the Senate.Youre sweet to be concerned.But I promise Ill be all right.I am concerned. Were friends are we notYes friends and nothing more.Satine as your friendI dont think you should makeany decisions in this state of mind.This state of mind And whatstate of mind would that be preciselyWhat Im saying is...Any person would be hystericalby now but...Hysterical The Republic isattempting to force its will upon innocent people. I only meant...Frankly Im surprisedyoure not hysterical.Perhaps if more citizens got hystericaltheyd be more inclined to speak upwhen the Republic trampleson their rights.Rushing in like this its...Its foolhardy.Ironic words from a man who spendshis days running hither and yonwielding his lightsaber with deadly forceas if on a crusade.Why should I listen to someonewho so frequently relies on violenceIn my opinionyoure the one whos foolhardy.EXPLOSIONBEEPING RAPIDLY Whats happening Its the navigation system.Get her out of here.Theres a platform ahead.Ill try to get closer.No stop AramisJumpWhat do you meanno charges are to be filed None at allSomeone tried to kill me.The controls on my speederwere compromised.Sadly my dear there is no proofanyone tampered with anything.Im afraid it might have beenjust an accident.An accidentAnd it just happened to coincidewith me defending my home world I agree with Satine. Well Finally.It proves what Ive been saying all along.Death Watch is out of control.The Republic must step in and help.No. Wait I didnt...You cant keep them reined in obviouslyso we will.This is patently offensive.You cant do this.Unfortunately it is up to the Senate now.Im sure theyll makea reasoned and thoughtful decision.Satine I just heard about your accident.Those two are...SIGHS This government will...EXCLAIMS IN FRUSTRATIONSatine tell me what happenedGRUNTS Im fine.

Theres no time for timeA murderer is on the looseand its my job to find himNow if I were a guywho committed senatorside...CLEARING THROATWhat makes you think it was murderPoison of courseThe politicians preferred method.Found a chemical in his bloodstreamkilled him right away.Its an obvious case.Politicians always have something to hideand it always comes back to haunt them.Am I rightLAUGHS Look who Im asking.Room full of politicians. Huh.So one of Farrs secretsmust have resurfaced.Ono had no secrets. Thats not it.Perhaps someone was upset about theclonetroop bill currently on the floor.Its very controversial.Thank you Senator... Amidala is itBut I already have my theory andIll follow my hunch if you dont mind.After all I am the inspectoryoure the senatorso Ill handle the inspectingand you can stick to the senating.Good day.Murder Its inconceivable.Who would wish Onaconda harmWhat if its the billWhat if were all being targetedSpeculation gets us nowhere.There is work to do.We should double our efforts on the vote.It will be even harder with Ono gone. No. No we should delay the vote. But whyNo one will give the votetheir full attentionuntil they know whats happened to Ono.Well maybe I can put a motionon the floor.I dont think anyone will objectgiven the circumstances.Good. Then well have timeto conduct our own investigation.Detective Divo specifically asked usnot to interfere.Well he didnt exactly inspire confidencedid heHe didnt know Ono. We did.Well have a far easier timelooking into this than Detective Divo will.Running aroundcould disrupt our coalition.Yet you still seem determinedto see this through.Indeed I am.And I dont suppose youd considerbringing Captain Typho with you.No Id rather do this quietly.Then perhaps Senator Organayou should accompany her.

I have no objections.And I know exactly where to start.LAUGHINGYoure suggesting one of uskilled Onaconda Farr. How delightful. I dont find any of this amusing.Neither do I.Every time Ono openedhis befuddled mouthit gave us another quoteto use in our fundraising.Why would we killour best source of incomeYou both opposed Onos ideasin the Senate.With enough at stake maybeyou decided to silence his voice for good.Onaconda and I were often at oddsbut I respected him.I respected him greatly.For the recordI had no respect for Onaconda whatsoever.Ono had a secret meeting at the docksunder the derrick majorthe night before he died.And you just happened to knowabout this meeting howOh I was having Ono followed.Just because I respected Onodoesnt meanI wasnt trying to get dirt on him. Of course. The point isa clandestine offthebooks meetingunder cover of darknessperhaps that location holds some clue.Fine. I will go look. But whatever we findIll have more questions for both of you.SQUEAKINGHave I said that I thinkwere very far out of our element hereYes Bail I believe you mentioned itonce or twice.You know using this investigationto bury your grief might not be the best way to...

Yes. Thats what Im saying.What if we were sent here on purpose To the docks YesWhat if this was all a setupWhat if Deechi sent us herejust so he could kill usIf we hurrywe might still be able to catch Deechi before he leaves the Senate.

Hes been stabbed.This is definitely gonna requireanother report.The killer is obviouslytargeting the leadership.You must stay here under my protection.Why So the killer cantake us all out at onceOh thats preposterous.Even if the killerdid get through my securityits very unlikely that all of youwould end up dead.Were far too easy a target sitting here.Im leaving.No you cant leave Lolo. I thinkin this instance the inspector is right.Out of my way.SIGHINGWho else knewyou were going to the docksJust Senator Burtoni. She wasthe only other one in the room with us.Burtoni ehSir Senator Burtoni is not here.Oh. Looks like that longnecked Kaminoanhas flown the coop.Its been a difficult time.Youve handled yourself well.I had to try.Ono believed if you see injusticeyou cant wait for someone else to fix it. You must stand up and get involved. He did.SCREAMINGHelp I have been attackedShes over there She tried to kill me What happened Senator Burtoni. She jumped me Shes in the East Wing corridor Hurry Guards GoYoure insane. I didnt kill anyone.Last thing I rememberI was walking to my office. Then I woke up here. Senator Lolo has a very different story. She says you attacked her. Attacked her LoloLAUGHINGIf I ever attack someone I hopeitll be someone mildly important.Someone like Senator FarrOno was a harmless bug.I wouldnt bother killing him.And Deechi was my ally.Ive been thinking about howyou were in Senator Amidalas office right before Farr died. So whatAnd Ive been thinking abouthow you were in Deechis officeto hear about that meeting at the docks.A meeting I think Farr had with you.It wasnt me You have no proofNo I have this.I ordered an extensive forensic reporton Farr as soon as he died.The poison which killed Farronly affects Rodian blood.And it was developedby Kaminoan scientists.But thats... I didnt kill himYoure Kaminoanyou had access to the poison.Thats motive meansand opportunity. GuardsBut the scan must be wrong.If the poison was in all our drinksLolo would have died too. What Shes Rodian.Shed have been poisoned too.Unless she didnt drink.But you drank right LoloLolo. You didnt drink did youYoure right.I should have pretended to drink.All right youre coming with mefor insurance.Why did you kill Ono He brought war to my planet. No He made a mistake Lolo.Which everyone seemed to forgetincluding you. I didnt.Did you honestly thinkhe had the moral right to lead usAfter he betrayed us He was sorry. He was weak.We needed someone with strengthto stand against this war.I tried to scare him at the docks buthe wouldnt go away. So I removed him.BEEPINGAnd when I heard Deechi knewabout that meeting he had to go too.Halt Put down your weapon.With the final votes talliedlet it be known that the motion to stopthe creation of more clone troopshas failedand the continued manufacturingof clone troopersshall proceed as scheduled.After all that we lost.I know this decision was most unexpected.I myself dont support itbut democracy must stand.Of course.

Got itas you wish.Esteemed colleaguesleaders of mandalore friendsIm afraid our neutrality hascaused our people to suffer.The war between theseparatists and the republicrages across Our galaxy.It has caused trade routesto be closed to mandaloreAnd has forced us to turn to ablack market filled with corruption.We know what is happening Almec. What will be done about it Mandalore should not needto pay smugglers to feed its people.Its not that we wantto deal with smugglers.We have no alternative.Im sure you and the trade Federationmake a profit whether ourbusiness is legitimate or not. I resent that ladies and gentlemenplease order.Please.prime minister almec seemsa bit overwhelmed.Your services as a negotiatorplease be my guest.Perhaps they will listento a new voice.Ruling councilmay I speakSenator amidala.The floor is yours.I hear your worriesyour frustrationBut the longer you arguethe more your people suffer.You are right. New trade routesare essential to survivalbut the black market is no substitutefor legitimate and legal trade. What would you propose Senator The republic can provide Security.The republics own dealingswith the black market far surpass mandalores. I agree.To come herea member of the Republic senateand lecture to us about corruption.The corporate alliancecontrols everything.SilenceI told senator amidala thatMandalore was not part of the Waryet here I find a battlein my own palace.I call this meeting adjourned.We will reconvene and allowcooler heads to prevail.Come on you worms.Get those barrels inside.What is this stuffThis stuff is slabinA diluting agent.If we add it we can make twiceas much tea at twice the profit.Isnt it toxicOnly if the dosage is wrongso get your mixture right.Tell me padmehow do you feel about the republicswar with the separatistsIts so complicated.As you know in the senatethe chancellor says its going very wellbut my sources say otherwise.and how does that make you feelthere are times I wish I couldfollow mandalores leadneutralityand not just in the war.But the politics as wellThe contamination ofgreed reaches deepand far within the republiccorporations trade guildsToo many senators servingtheir own interests.There are still those of us who workto overcome the corruption andbelieve it to be possible.Enough of this dreary talk.A new hospital has opened.Tomorrow you and I shall visitsee true good at work.It will do us good.Orderly whats going on hereI have no idea madam.Dr. Zaz is handling the Outbreak.Hes inside.What is happening hereDuchess Im sorry no onehas come to speak to you. These children have been Poisoned. HowWe dont know.Im afraid.Weve gotten reportsfrom across the planet.Have you identified a causeThe children here allcame from the same school.Were testing their food.If we find somethingperhaps we can create an antidote.But it will take some time.Which they may not have.PUBWhat if its not a poison It must be death watch. Im not so sure.In the past the death watchattacks have only been directedat myself and the administrationnot the children.They are terrorists.Perhaps the senators visithas inspired them.TerroristsOur minds should be on the sickchildren that are dying in the streets.What are you going to doto save themI must speak to the rulingcouncil about this matter.I refuse to believe that Death Watchhas anything to do with this.I agree. His concernfor the children...was practically none.All he thinks about is politics.Well we cant just sit hereand do nothing.My thoughts exactly.Thank you all for coming.I suppose youre wonderingwhy I asked you here.As my personal guards you arethe only ones I can trustto investigate this matter.We have little time.That is why I have askedfor your help.PadmeEach of you will be getting aspecial comlink and datapadMeans of direct communicationand location you should investigate.This must be a closedloop affair.Hundreds of childrenhave been poisoned.they are our childrenand they need our help.This is a mandalorian matterAnd we must find outwho dares poison our children.Thank you.Thank you all. So where do we start The schools.Thank you for allowing us toinspect the school superintendent.My pleasure duchess.Weve cleared the food here.None of it is tainted.What about what theyate yesterdaythe menu of food is prettyregular here.We wouldve caught somethingwith our tests.What about their drinks DoctorNo they drink fresh water.Its impossible for it to be tainted.Not the water.What about the bottled drinksThose are not part ofthe schools menu.They are allowed throughan outside vendor.Excuse me child.I must borrow your drink.How could this have happenedIts not your fault.I appreciate that.However for an outbreakof this size to occurIm afraid its a sign of a muchmuch deeper seeded corruption than I had imagined. Duchess we found something.This tea contains ahigh level of slabin.I didnt know slabin was lethal.it usually isntbut mixed with the teaand at this concentrationIm certain its the causeof the childrens Illness.The school must have animport log correctYes.I believe so.So we should be able to findout where the tea came from.Well then lets get to the docks.Everythings here satine.Everything except the recordsfor the tea shipments.It looks like the schools importlog has been erased.Theres no record ofan outside vendor.superintendenthold it right thereIm actually on my wayto the hospital. I have to go.Stop himTell me whats going on hereOr else my guards will not be as Satine... Padme please.Where did you get the teaPlease I never meantto harm anyone. I justI needed to cut costs.The schools budget was too low.The school has receivedsufficient government funding.Look they offered me a great deal.I could keep somemoney for myself toobut I didnt know thatthe drinks were poison.All this because you were greedyI am not the only one makingmoney off this operation.There are others moreguilty than I am.Was death watch involvedDeath WatchI dont know.I dealt with a middlemanan importer.His names Siddiq.He works for a shippingcompany not too far from here.Tell us where.Sure I bribed the school official.Whats the problemWhat youve done is illegal.Beyond these starstheres a war going on.As long as my company imports goodsmost people turn a blindeye to anything else.We are not most people Mr. Siddiq.my corporate contractsprotect me DuchessSo Ill play your little game.Look Im sorry thereare sick children. I truly am.But Im just a messenger.Where do yoget the teaFrom mooga.The commerce guild controls it.Here I have nothing to hide.Here we are.Shipping schedules from mooga.Right there the highlighted ones.And a customs official reportsthese to the governmentAs far as I know.Are these all for the onesbringing in the teaNo Id have to narrow that down.Okay okay.No problem.There you go.Look theyre actuallybringing in a shipment tonight.You want to know which dockI must say when I came to visithadnt pictured us insuch an informal setting.Yes well from whatmaster Kenobi tells meDuring your tenure as queen you becamequite familiar with such excursions.one can only survive the rigors ofcourtly formalities for so long.We are of the same mind.Duchess theres a shipment arriving.The smugglers. Well soon find out. Shall I call in more securityNo lets wait andsee what transpires.Look a customs official.Welcome back gentlemen.Im here for my...Inspection.Certainly.How can they operatewith such impunityI need to find out how far up the chainof command this corruption goes.PUBIm sorry duchess but whatyoure saying Its impossible.impossible We witnessed itwith our own eyes.Bribery of a customs officialat the shipping docksIm afraid not.The docks are a highly secure areafree of dangerous criminals.but not free of corruption.The most dangerous weapon inthe galaxy is money captain.Smuggling does not takeplace on my watch.And what about whenyoure not watchingIm always watching senator.and were you watching aschildren were dyingWho was watching then Duchess with all due respect... No captain.If you want my respect you will arrestthese criminals and stop stalling.StallingWhy else would you not be down therewith a patrol unit making arrestsunless youre involvedAll right.Well see whats going on.Satine what are thoseguards doing here Did you order them hereDuchess Ive been with youthe whole time.Guards let us into this warehouse.Were under strict ordersnot to let anyone in.Do you know who this isI command youopen these doors.Arrest themHold it right there.Impressive shooting for a senator.Captain I want you to burndown this warehouse.Excuse me But theres evidence Burn it down or Ill consider youa part of this conspiracy captain.You heard her men.Burn the warehouse.It wasnt death watchPrime minister.It was a group of blackmarket Smugglers.They were diluting thedrink with slabin.What they didnt count on was theprocess would make the drinks poisonous.And what about the sick childrenI ordered shipments of the antidotefor all the schools and hospitals.Im glad this is over.No Im afraid its not over.The corruption wewitnessed is intolerable.Payoffs police unwilling tocomply my government fooled...How does this happenIm sorry. Im setting up acommittee to look into it.Children nearly died becauseour government cannot be counted on.I assure you this will notgo unpunished.Im counting on you Almec.Im troubled padme.You heard prime minster almecsay hell investigate.His heart is in the right placebut this corruption... You must have hope satine. Hope will only go so far.The very people conducting thisinvestigation might be corrupt.Perhaps a jedi working undercover atthe academy could be of service to usAnd in more ways than oneFor if we lose our youngMandalore will indeed be lost.I will speak With master yoda.Dont lose hope my friend. Senator. Duchess.", "A world in crisisThe peaceful planet of Mandalore isbeing strangled by the grip of corruption.With shortages of every kindcitizens must turn to the black marketin order to survive.Desperate to free her peopleDuchess Satinehas asked her friend Padm Amidalato speak with the Jedi Councilin hopes that they will send assistanceto her struggling world.The Jedi Council hasgiven you a mission Ahsoka.Its your duty to see it through.Dont you thinkIm just a little overqualified for this\n\n\nAccording to Senator AmidalaMandalore is a deeply corrupt world.If the cycle is to be brokenthe future leaders atthe Royal Academy of Governmentmust learn the evils of corruption.Yoda feels that only a young Padawanlike you can get through to them.My lady if I maywhat do the Jedi know of our waysDo we really want them meddlingwith our childrens educationSurely there is nothing to fearfrom exposing them to new ideasPrime Minister.Duchess Satine.Prime Minister Almec.Master Skywalkerso good to see you again.This is your Padawan I assumeYes my lady. May I present Ahsoka Tano.\n\n\nDuchess. Prime Minister.I am grateful that the Jedi Councilcould spare the two of youto help instruct our leadersand peacekeepers of tomorrow.Please thank Master Yoda for me.Im afraid thatdue to our limited resourcesI must return to battle immediately.So you will not be stayingMaster SkywalkerNo but I assure youPadawan Tano is a highly capable Jediand has the full confidence of the Council.Very well. Cadet Korkie Amis Lagos.These are some of the cadets thatyou will be instructing Padawan Tano.Nice to meet all of you. Thats a fine weapon. May I see it Im afraid not.Because of Master Kenobis recent visitand the trouble that followedno offworlders may carry weaponson Mandalore.Master ObiWan caused troubleThats a first.Just give me the lightsaber.Thank you for respecting our waysMaster Jedi.Excuse the interruption sirbut it is time to depart.General Fisto is expecting us.If youll excuse me.Corruption is what happenswhen someone in powerputs their own personal gainbefore the interests ofthe people they represent. So its a result of greed Yes.A leader sacrifices moral integrityfor the sake of money or power.Entire star systems have collapsedinto chaos or revolutionbecause their greedy politiciansgot caught upin a cycle of bribery and blackmailwhile their people suffered.Does that meanmost government officials are corruptWell no.But the point isthat temptation is always thereand citizens must be vigilantso corruption cant take root.The deadliest enemies of a societydwell within its borders.And from these internal threatsthe people need to be protected.But if you dont trust your leadersisnt that treasonIts every citizens dutyto challenge their leadersto keep them honest andhold them accountable if theyre not.How do you do thatBy exposing corrupt officialsfor what they are.Lasting change can only come from within.Be sure your assignmentsare prepared for tomorrow.The schools out of rations again.I guess therell beno latenight snacks tonight.Listen weve had a food shortagesince the war began.Transport ships keep coming inbut theres strict rationing.Something is wrong on Mandalore.But these problems are bigger than us.Just let the authorities handle it.We have to do something about itlike Ahsoka said.Lets go down to the warehouse districtand see if there really is a food shortage.Beats sitting around herelistening to my stomach growl.These doors are heavily securedby the government.It wont be secure for long.Looks like the Academy taught us well.Come on up and over.I have a bad feeling about this. What are you doing QuietIt sounds like someone else is in here. Lets get out of here. No Come onThe risk involved makes the price go up.You must be more cautious.Coming here could raise suspicion.Its a little late for a meeting isnt itLets get a closer look.Are you crazyIt wasnt my idea.Soniee quick use your holocam.Those look like Mandalorian policebut theyre unmarked.Whos thatAnd who are those guysWhat are offworlders doingon a secure portI dont like this. Im getting out of here.Hurry This wayHey NoWhat are we going to doThis is bigger than we thought.Were going to need help.We should speak to my Aunt Satine.Aunt Satine may we speak with youOf course Korkie. Come in.We did some investigating.Theres no food shortage. We foundstores of food at the government port. How would you know this That doesnt matter right now.I beg to differ.We made a recording of a secret meetingbetween what we knowwas a government officialand a black marketeer.Thats why everything costs so muchand so many people are starving.We need your helpto find the one responsible.This is a serious matter I agree.But the source of this evil may bemore than you cadets can handle.People can be very deceiving.You dont want toget yourselves into trouble.But Auntie dont you seeYou cant ignore thisI wont trust me.But for your own safetyyou must let me take care of it.Now run along all of you.Concentrate on your studies.There will be a time to save the worldwhen youre a bit older.She refused to help us becauseshe doesnt think we can handle it.She just thinkswere a bunch of stupid kids.She acted like nothing was wrong.We need to find someone elsewho believes us.Like whoMandalore has two people in charge.Since my aunt wont helpwell have to go to the Prime Minister.What makes you think hell listenIve known him my whole life.Hes always told me to come to himif Im ever in trouble.And Id say were all in big trouble.I am most concerned by these allegationsmy intrepid young cadets.You think Duchess Satine knowswho the conspirator isShe said she was going to handle it.Meet me in the Palace Plaza tonight.Bring the recording you tookof the black market dealand all the cadets who know about it.Korkie you seem distracted today.Whats going onWe did what you said.We found evidence of corruption.What do you meanWell we were hungryso we decided to go look for food. Food Yeah.Down at the government warehouse.Someone just let you into inspect the warehouse No we broke in. Oh great.So you committed a crimeIt sounds bad I know but thenwe saw a meeting and offworlders and...And they chased usMaybe they chased youbecause you broke intoa government warehouse.No It was a black market deal. I know itMy Aunt Satine told us to stay out of itbut we must do something. Do you have proof We made a holorecording.The Prime Ministeris meeting us tonight to...Are you sure thats a good ideaBut I thought you said it was the duty ofevery citizen to expose corrupt officials.Im only sayingthat you should take this slowly.Examine all of the facts and all ofthe people involved before you act.You sound more like my auntthan a Jedi Knight.You KorkiePrime Minister is that youSecret Service. You are all under arrestfor treason corruption and conspiracy.You will come with us.These are the same guardswe saw last night.Weve done nothing wrong.Looks like the Prime Minister set you up.Thats treason.Hes the leader of our system.He couldnt possibly be a traitor.We need proof.We have the recording.Thats no good. You cant see who it is.Wait Stop right there.Information retrievalI need you to ID a hologram.Thats himYoure right That is the Prime Minister.We have to take this to my auntand warn her.They know I talked to her.Were too late.Hes dead.Korkie waitThe intruders may still be inside.They took her. This is all my faultWho knows what theyve done to her.Now whatHow are we supposed to find herWho can we trustI need all of you to calm down and focus.We know the Prime Minister is behind this.After my aunt hes the mostpowerful person on Mandalore.So lets go talk to him.Master Jedithis is an unexpected pleasure.What can I do for youActually Prime Ministerits what I can do for you.I believe some of my studentsare involved in a conspiracy against you.Intriguing.You cant do thisWe trusted you Master Tano.Thank you for bringing the traitorsto justice Master Jedi.They mentioned thatDuchess Satine was their leader.We should arrest her too.Do not worrywe already have her in custody.Really WhereThat is none of your concern.Now I must prepare a public statementabout the Duchess and her crimes.Officer I need to interrogatethe prisoners immediately.Careful. Were being watched.Did he buy it Have you found my aunt Not exactly.But I know they have her in custody. Where The Prime Minister wouldnt tell me.I knew this plan wouldnt work.Have a little faith. Ill find her.Well just modify the plan a bit.How are you going to do thatDont worry. Youll know when to actwhen I give the signal. Whats the signal Youll know it when you see it. You will take me to Duchess Satine. I will take you to Duchess Satine.What are you doing I must interrogate the Duchess. You must interrogate the Duchess.Im getting you out of here.Ahsoka its a trap.I see you found the Duchess youngling.You may stopyour playacting now Sergeant.

Sign the confessionand admit to your treasonous ways.There is only one traitorto Mandalore here Prime Ministerand thats youYou control the black market.You have betrayed the public trustand used your officeto accumulate wealth and power.Its shameful.Your idealism is inspiringmy dear but hopelessly naive.I established the black marketfor the people.Thats absurdThe war is disrupting tradeacross the galaxy.The profits from the black marketare being used to purchasehumanitarian supplies for Mandalore.Think of it as a new taxin the interest of national security.Its a tax for your benefit Prime Minister.Where are these humanitarian suppliesyou speak ofSergeant put the shock collar on her.My patience has worn thin Duchess.Maybe this will convince you.I would rather diethan sign your confession.That can be arranged.Youre wasting your timeBring me those traitorous cadets.No you cant Theyre just childrenAll right lets move.Im afraid your nephewwill have to suffer needlessly.Put the shock collar on Cadet Korkie.GoGotchaStop fightingSend for my personal guards.You must know by nowthat I didnt bring you here just to teach.I knew something was amissbut I had no one to trust.I thought if I brought a Jediespecially a friend of Senator Amidalaswe could solve this mystery together.I never doubted you Duchess.Neither did we.It was an honorto serve with a Jedi Knight.It was my privilege to be your teacher.I hope this assignmentwasnt too boring for you.It had its moments.Like the onewhere you convinced untrained childrento help you overthrowa corrupt governmentThat was a highlight.It sounds pretty risky.Youre lucky you didnt get hurt.Nothing you wouldnt have done.", "Criminals capturedJedi Master Plo Koonand Padawan Ahsoka Tanosuccessfully thwarted an attempton Mace Windus lifekilling bounty hunter Aurra Singin the process.Since that time young Ahsokahas grown strong in the ways of the Force.Now after several harrowing adventuresalongside her masterthe two Jedi have returned to the Templeon Coruscant to receive their next mission.Welcome Padawan.In order congratulations are.Shown your courage and strengthyet again you have.Job well done Ahsoka.And now on to more pressing matters.\n\n\nTo Balith you must go Skywalker.Theres a largescale civil war on Balith.They have requested our assistance.Anakin you will leave immediatelyto command the third legion.Ive never been to Balith.You will stay here Padawanwe need your full report.As you wish.Ahsoka I sense you are uneasy.

What number number .Thats outright theft.Your previous arrangementwith the Republic was number number .Please pleasethat was before deregulation.The same rules dont apply my dear.The separatists dontseem to mind a rate hike.In fact they just secured a loan to fundan additional number  million battle droids.They would wipe us out.You would let Dooku do thatYou live on Coruscant too.We have no stakein this war senator.You know that.War is...Distasteful to all of us.number number  interest.Thats a lot of credits.The interest alone couldcompletely bankrupt the Republic.As it is social services havesuffered because of this wareducation infrastructurehealth care.If we go deeper into debt the basicneeds of our people will evaporate.This is good.It isClearly taking out a loanon such obscene termswould essentially destroy the Republicregardless of the outcome of the war.We only need to swayanother handful of senatorsas long as they dontbuckle to the threats.What threatsSome members havereceived messageswarning them not tovote against the bill.Considering whats happenedto your friend Bonteritheyre frightened.A mandatory blackout is in progress.All citizens report tothe designated safe area.A mandatory blackout is in progress.All citizens report to thedesignated safe area.Cant you all see thisbill is shortsightedMillions of clones wont win this war.The only winner will be the banking clan.They want to pass this bill so badlytheyre using scare tacticsto sway votes.I am not intimidatedsenator Amidala.Then why are youvoting for additional troopsI happen to believe moreclones are precisely what we needand my caucus agreeswith me.

Lets take them.Yeah leave it to Hardcaseto dive in head first.The Generals new plan is reckless.You ever think that maybethe General knows what he is doingI know you think this is a bad idea.I raised my objectionto General Krells planbut he didnt agree.So this is it.What if hes wrong Then whatThis isnt the time for a debate.Right now we have to stay alert.Eh its too quiet out there.Mines Nobody moveOz is down.So is Ringo.Can you sweep themThere are more over here.Looks like the whole roadsbeen booby trapped.Everyone watch your step.Were completely exposed.Hold your groundYou want a piece of thisUhoh.

Yes sir.Sir if I may address your accusationI followed your orders.Even in the face of a planthat was in my opinion severely flawed.A plan that cost us men.Not clones MenAs sure as it is my dutyto remain loyal to your commandI also have another duty.To protect those men.You have a spark of tenacity Captain.Ill give you that.I know that I dont commandlike the Jedi youre used to servingcertainly not like General Skywalkerbut I have my way.It may be difficultbut these are difficult times.And its proven effective.And I suppose your loyalty to your menis to be commended.They seem to admire this.Thats importantto an effective commander.All right Captain Rexyour opinion has been noted.Dismissed.I think he almost complimented you.Its hard to tell.IncomingGet back Get backThe Umbarans must have regroupedfor a counterattack.Everyone we must hold this positionYou think General Krellstill intends on taking the capitalusing this strategyI dont know.

I cant believe a Jediwould attack a place this sacred.Wed like for you two to leadthe investigation.We cant trust anyonewho was here even a Jedi.You and Ahsoka will providean impartial point of viewfree of assumptions.Well do everything we can.Careful you must be Skywalker.If willing to destroy the Templethe attacker isto great lengths they will goto keep from being caught.Then I guess well have to goto even greater lengthsto catch him.I can still hear the screams.Do you believe what they said Masterthat a Jedi could do thisNot every Jedi agreeswith this war Ahsoka.There are manypolitical idealists among us.But a traitorIm afraid one can eventuallybecome the other.Remember Count Dooku and General Krell.Thats how they started too.Only analysis and investigationwill prove what is true or not.Who are youI am RussoISCCrime Scene Analyzer for the Jedi.I will be working with youand your Padawan on this case.I was assigned by Master Windu.Okay Russoyou and Ahsoka shouldbegin the interviews.I would rather interviewthe witnesses alone.WhyMany of the wounded have heard rumorsa Jedi was behind this explosion.There will be ill will toward you.I think youre overexaggerating Russo.There were Jedi killed in that blastalong with maintenance crew and clones.Take Ahsoka with you.Let me know if you find anything.I will Master.Did you notice anything unusualabout the hangarNot really.Although I left thehangar five minutes beforethe bomb exploded.Did everything seem okay before thatEverything seemed normal.Is it true a Jedi might beresponsible for the attackWere not certain of anythingat this point.This distrust is troubling.Some of these people have workedin the Temple for years.Fear makes even the mosttrusting individual irrational.I think I know who did itwho blew up the hangar.WhoI believe it was Jackar Bowmani.Jackar Bowmani.Who is JackarOne of the maintenance crewin the hangar.Why do you think it was himI passed him as I was goingon my shift change.He...he had been working all morningin the section the blast came from.It was the last place I saw him.Is this himYes.I need to know have youseen him since the explosionNo.Truthfully I didnt see muchof anything after the explosion.Thank you.Looks like we need to findJackar Bowmani Russo.Did you find anythingNo but the rumor about itbeing a Jedi is growing Ahsoka.I can feel the anger and confusionthroughout the Jedi Temple.Russo and I have a lead.We are looking for one of theTemple workers Jackar Bowmani.One of the witnesses saw him in the areawhere the bomb explodedright before it happenedand we have not been ableto find him anywhere.Come on. Nobody just disappears.Unless it was well planned out.Well it had to be wellplanned out to get past Jedi.Ill talk to security.No more clones.Stop the violence.End the war.Stop the violence.Theyre all family and friendsYes looking for answers.So am I Cin.This is the guy who might bebehind all of this.If you see him alert me immediately.That is Jackar.You know this manHe is my husband.Ive been trying to reach himsince I heard of an explosion.Where is heI need you to come with me.You have no idea where Jackar isNo.You are a Jedi and you cannot find himI understand your frustration.Dont. Just find Jackar.Letta do you think Jackarcould do something like thisblow up the TempleDo you have any ideawhat someone has to go throughto work in the Jedi Temple hmJackar dedicated his lifeto serving the Jedi.It had been his dream.Not just anyone can walk intoyour precious Temple.He passed all the entry teststhat were needed.Okay I had to ask.Unfortunately everyones a suspect.Jackar would never do anythinglike this.Please find him.Hmm...based on the trajectory of the debrisit seems the blast came from there.Why is there no bomb residueSo you think whoever did thistriggered a ship to explodeWe think so.Russos trying to use theshrapnel to determine that now.The witness says he saw Jackarin the area.Maybe Jackar planned to do thisand just kept quiet.Or...It actually was a Jedi.I found something an anomalysomething that should not be here.These pieces came from the blast origin.They are covered with microscopic droidsof a highly volatile nature.Nanodroids.Yes nanodroids.Great.Now were chasing nanodroids.Russo go through security footage.Try to see if Jackar wentto other parts of the Temple.Ahsoka lets go find outhow Jackar got his handson these nanodroids.Bowmanis file Master Jedi.Hes a munitions expert.Jackar was the foreman overall of the gunshipsbombs and weapons.His specialty was nanoweaponry.Weve got to find this guy.Isnt that going a littletoo fast for youto make sense out of itIt is simple data.At this pace I am able to viewhundreds of hours of footage.Have you found JackarNo.Ill gather some Jediand search the Temple.If hes still here he might beplanning another attack.Instead of JediI have droidsthat can do the job much faster.So youve found nothing so farWe have a clue were following.But we still dont have answers.It is imperativethat the truth be found soon.There are whispersthe Senate will have a meetingto decide whether the military policewill need to become involvedin the investigation.They cant do that.Clones died in that explosionmaintenance clones workingon the gunshipsas well as civilians.The Senate tends to take noticeof these thingsno matter where they happen.Master Skywalker we have found Jackar.Lock down all exits so he cant escape.Where is heWell part of him is here.I dont think nowis a good time to joke.This is all that remains of Jackar.His handThe rest of him exploded.Because he was so close to the bombBecause he was the bomb.Whats thisThe connection we were looking forto the explosion in the hangar.The nanodroids.How did they get in his bloodstreamOh this just keeps gettingbetter and better.Were going to have to searchJackars home for evidence.This is not the nicest place.I wouldve thought workingfor the Jedi paid better.Letta Are you hereYou search for the droidsbut be carefuland remember he was a munitions expert.Id rather not set offanother explosion today.Ill see if he left a note.LettaMaster.The sensors are picking uptraces from the disposal.The nanodroidswere in the food.Well I guess the question now isdid he eat them willinglyor did someone feed them to himWhwhat are you doing hereWeve learned Jackarwas involved in the bombing.That cant be true.See if she has any nanodroidson her Ahsoka.NanodroidsShes clean.What do you mean nanodroidsWe believe someone set Jackarup and made him the bomb.I... I dont understand.Letta I want to bring you infor more questioning.Maybe you can help us make senseout of all of this.Ill answer any question I can.Letta stop.LettaLetta.Take the high road.Right Master.Letta stopLet me go.Running means you know morethan youre telling us.Jackar is deadand now youre trying to blamehis murder on me.Nobody ever said he was dead.But running proves you hadsomething to do with the bomb.You dont know whatyoure talking about.People blamed Jedi because of you.People were killed because of youYou cant prove anything.Did you feed the nanodroidsto JackarYou will answer me.NowI did feed the nanodroidsto Jackar.You set up your own husband to dieYoure dealing with thingsyou dont understand.Oh where youre goingyoull have plenty of timeto explain everything.Were holding Lettain the cell below the templeto await further questioning.I am pleased to reportthere were no other nanodroidsfound in the sweep of the Temple.I am also pleased to reportbased on the security footageJackar Bowmani acted alonewhich means no Jedi was involved.Thanks Russo.Good job.Did this woman say what herreasons were for attacking usNot yet but were working on that.I think we can guessher motives easily enough.Public opinion isswaying against the Jedi.That is becoming clear.This war is becoming lessand less popularevery day it persists.Master Im relievedwe solved this case but...What if it had been a JediYes.I dont know how I would have feltif a Jedi was really behind this.There are going to be Jediwho disappoint us Ahsoka.But as long as we knowthere are good Jediwho fight for whats rightit makes it all worthwhile.", "orchestral fanfarestar wars themedMale narratorTerror at the templeThe jedi templeis in disarrayAfter a viciousterrorist attack.Anakin skywalkerand ahsoka tanoSet out to find the truthOf who was really behindthis horrendous catastrophe.Their investigation led themto discover the true saboteurLetta turmond.\n\n\nNow the jedi attempt to returnthe temple to normalcy.But first master yodamust give a eulogyTo the fallen jedi warriors.

Ever.These are strange times.I thought we decidedwe were going to part ways.Ugh ahAhHow am I supposed to find a cluewhen I dont even knowwhat Im looking forUhVentressI see youve had a change of heart.Why bring me hereAnswer me Ventress.WhyAhCalling all units.Suspicious activity on level number number number number .Ugh.NanodroidsNo Wolffe let me explain.Explosives.These are the same typesof nanodroidsthat were used to blow upthe Jedi Temple.I cant believe it.Captured she has beenYes Master Yoda.Without incidentNo she was subdued by the clonesand found in possessionof explosive nanodroids.It still doesnt explainVentresss involvement.We saw her with Ahsoka.I think theres more going onthan we know.By Ahsoka or against herThat remains to be seen.Were bringing her back to the temple.Lets just hope we can keep her here.", "Ahsoka Tano capturedWhile on the run to prove her innocencePadawan Tano teamed upwith the deadly Asajj Ventressto find the rogue Jediwho framed Ahsoka for murder.The Jedi Council sent Anakin Skywalkerand Master Plo Koon to track Ahsoka downand bring her back to the Temple.Now captured and imprisonedAhsoka faces punishmentfor crimes she did not commit.The Senate requeststhat Ahsoka Tano be indictedfor acts of treasonagainst the Republic.\n\n\nA fair trial Padawan Tano will havein accordance with Jedi tradition.Ah yes Jedi tradition.Im afraid Master Yodathat the Senate believesthat an internal Jedi trialwould seem biased.Therefore the Senate asksthat the Council expelAhsoka Tano from the Jedi Orderso that she may be putto a Republic Military tribunalwhere she will receivemore impartial judgment.And who would represent Ahsokain this tribunal AdmiralThat would be upto the Council Generalbut I would recommendsomeone outside the Order.Of course.\n\n\nThe Council will actas they deem necessary.Thank you Admiral.Surely we cannot dowhat Tarkin suggests.We need to stand together with Ahsoka.And yet theres evidencethat she is indeedthe mastermind behind the attackon the Temple.She was found in possessionof nanodroid explosives.This alone is enough to convict her.I understand your sentimentObiWanbut if the Council does as you suggestit could be seen as an act of oppositionto the Senate.Im afraid we have little choice.Hmm.To the Chamber of Judgmentsummon Skywalker and his Padawanand in our decisionmay the Force guide us.Youre not helping.Im sorry Snips.I just... I just dont knowwhat to do.Its okay.I dont either.Padawan Tanoserious chargeshave been levied against you.How plead youNot guilty Master.I would never take the livesof innocents.The values of the Jedi are sacred to me.There is evidence to the contrary.You were alone withLetta Turmond when she died.Can you explain thisSomeone used the Force against her.Which brings us to Ventress.Can you explain your associationwith herWe had a mutual understanding.I thought she was helping me.Did you she help you acquirethe nanodroid weaponryfound when you were apprehendedthe same devices usedin the bombing of the TempleNo I was set up and deceivedas you are being deceived now.The question is Padawan Tanowho is deceiving usVentress you or someone elseI am not deceiving you.I would assume Ventress isbut I cant be sure.My sense is clouded.Clouded by the dark sidethese things are Padawan Tano.Dangerously cloudedbut not just surrounding yousurrounding many things in these times.Youve already madeyour decision havent youThis meeting is just a formalityReached a decision we havethough not in total agreement are we.It is the Councils opinionthat Padawan Ahsoka Tanohas committed seditionagainst the Republicand thus she will be expelledfrom the Jedi Order.You cant do thisYour Padawan statuswill be stripped from youand you shall forfeitall rank and privilegeswithin the Grand Army of the Republic.You will be turned overto the Republic courtsto await your trailand whatever punishmentthey will set for you.Henceforth you are barredfrom the Jedi Order.Padm has agreed to representyou before the Senate.I will do everything I canto prove your innocence Ahsoka.I am almost certainthat the person behind thisis Ventressand you know I wasnt working with her.She was at the warehouse...in the room.We fought but she got away.Didnt any of the clones see anythingNo none of the clonesreported seeing Ventressat the scene.I thought you said Ventress leftbefore you went into the warehouse.Thats what I thought toobut then she attacked mewhen I got inside.Id know her red lightsabers anywhere.Well if thats our only leadthen I know what I have to do.Wait where are you goingYou cant leave now.Yes I can.I have to find Ventressand get to the bottom of this.Until we hear from Anakinlets work on your defense.Forgive me if Im not optimistic.I thought I was part of that Orderbut everyone except Anakinhas abandoned me.Im not holding out much hopethe Senate will treat me any better.Anakin Skywalker.I know youre behind all of this.Prove it.Leave me alone.Tell me what happened.When I heard your little bratwas on the runI thought she might bringa large bounty.BountyI was going to catch your petand turn her over to the authoritiescollect whatever bounty was due.What stopped youAt first... I admit... I wasjust interested in the moneyand a little bit of revengebut then I realizedyour fallen Padawan and Ihad a lot in common.How dare you compare yourself to AhsokaIts true.My master abandoned meand thats exactly what you did to heryou and your precious Jedi Order.Ahsoka Tanoyou have been charged with seditionagainst the Jedi Orderand the Republic itself.This court will decide your fate.Prosecution you may beginyour arguments.Former Padawan TanoI shall provethat you were the mastermindbehind the attack on the Jedi Templeand that once your accomplicescarried out your ordersyou eliminated them one by one.When you are found guiltyI ask the courtthat the full extent of the lawbe brought down upon youincluding penalty of death.After I left the warehouseafter I left your little Padawan aloneI was walking awayand I thought she came upbehind me to talk more.But I was wrong.Someone came out of nowhereand hit me from behind.Not just anyone can sneak up behind me.It had to be another Jedi.I dont believe you.Believe it.Whoever youre looking forhas my lightsabers.Thats how youll knowyouve found the criminal.Well this leads me to a dead end.Youre the only oneAhsoka had talked to.Thats not true.What do you meanYour Padawan contacted the Temple.She spoke to someone named Barriss.Thats why we knewto go to the warehousein the first place.It was this Barrissthat told us to go there.If youre lying youre dead.Such promises.Look at the facts.Letta Turmond called Ahsoka to her cellto reveal the nameof the true mastermindbehind the bombing of the Jedi Temple.Letta told Ahsoka she was afraid.She told her the mastermind was a Jediand before she could revealthe Jedis nameLetta Turmond was strangled to deathby way of the Force.Why would Ahsoka kill Lettawith a method that would so obviouslytie the murder to herA Jedi may be responsiblefor the murderbut that Jedi is not Ahsoka Tano.Members of the courtyou are prosecuting the wrong Jedi.Well said Senator Amidala.However if she is innocentthen why was she seen conspiringwith known Separatist terrorist.Asajj VentressVentress set me up.My master will prove that.And where is your masterHes trying to find the real murderer.Then maybe he should be looking at you.Enter.Barriss I need to talk to you.Master Skywalkerhow can I help youI was told that you spoke with Ahsokabefore she was arrested.What did you say to herWeve been friends for a long time.I was only trying to help her.I hope Im not in any trouble.Its no trouble.I just need to know what you told herand if you told anyone else.No I thought I had a clue for herbut I really couldnt tell her anything.Who told you I spoke to herVentress.She told me.VentressIsnt she the one Ahsoka saysis really behind all thisThats what Ahsoka saysbut I think shes wrong.Ventress thinkssomeone else is involved.And you believe herWho else could it be if not herSurely not Ahsoka.No I dont think it was Ahsoka either.I think both Ahsoka and Ventressare telling the truthbut theres only one way to find out.Funny. Those belong to Ventress.You shouldve gotten rid of themI think they suit me.Im sure many of youlook at this former Jediand think Surelyshe cannot be this murdereror saboteur that they speak of.And yet think of all the timeswe have been fooledby the Separatistsand how they have infiltratedthe Republicand ask yourselfIs this yet anotherSeparatist schemeAnother way to rip the Jediand subsequently all of usapart.Ahsoka trusted youand you betrayed her.Ive learned that trust is overrated.The only thingthe Jedi Council believes inis violence.Cease hostilityBarrissLook outThe members of the courthave reached a decision.Ahsoka Tanoby an overwhelming count of...Chancellor.I hope you have a reasonfor bursting into our proceedingsMaster Skywalker.Im here with evidence and a confessionfrom the person responsiblefor all the crimes.Ahsoka has been accused of.Barriss Offee member of the Jedi Orderand traitor.Barriss is that trueTell them the truth.I did itbecause Ive come to realizewhat many of people in the Republichave come to realizethat the Jedi are the onesresponsible for this warthat weve so lost our waythat we have become villainsin this conflictthat we are the onesthat should be put on trialall of usAnd my attack on the Templewas an attackon what the Jedi have becomean army fighting for the dark sidefallen from the lightthat we once held so dear.This Republic is failingIts only a matter of time.Take her away.AhsokaI am so sorryabout everything.You have our most humble apologieslittle Soka.The Council was wrong to accuse you.You have shown suchgreat strength and resiliencein your struggleto prove your innocence.This is the true sign of a Jedi Knight.This was actually your great trial.Now we see that.We understand that the Forceworks in mysterious waysand because of this trialyou have become a greater Jedithan you would have otherwise.Back into the Order you may come.Theyre asking you back Ahsoka.Im asking you back.Im sorry Masterbut Im not coming back.Ahsoka waitAhsoka I need to talk to you.Why are you doing thisThe Council didnt trust meso how can I trust myselfWhat about meI believed in you.I stood by you.I know you believe in me Anakinand Im grateful for that.But this isnt about you.I cant stay here any longernot now.The Jedi Order is your life.You cant just throw it away like this.Ahsoka you are making a mistake.Maybe but I haveto sort this out on my ownwithout the Counciland without you.I understand.More than you realizeI understand wantingto walk away from the Order.I know.", "NARRATOR Battle for Ringo Vinda.Republic forces are locked inheated combat with the droid armadaon a massive space stationthat encircles an entire planet.Anakin Skywalker valiantlyleads his men against the onslaughtwhich has lasted several rotationswith neither side gaining any ground.Aided by the twin sister Jedi MastersTiplee and Tiplarthe Republic now mountsa desperate offensiveto break the deadlock.Push forwardTUP Stay to my left.

Fives.Oh...The difference is minimal.Not to me. And not to any clone.It appears there has been a preemptiveexecution of Clone Protocol number number .How did this happenI do not know as of yet.However I recommendwe terminate the cloneand do a full autopsy to discoverhow the inhibitor chip was activated.And what of the JediThe Jedi Shaak Ti is proposingan atomiclevel brain scan.She has gone to the Jedi Council toseek their approval before proceeding.We must contact Lord Tyranus.Ive been expecting your transmission.I have heardof the malfunctioning clone.How widespread is the problemIt seems to be an isolated incident.However this is a delicate situation.We need to terminate the cloneas soon as possiblein order to extract and analyze theinhibitor chip that you provided to us.Very good.Terminate the clone immediately.However send the chipto me for analysis.And what if the Jedi ask for the chipand the results of the autopsyYou must rememberthe chip is a safeguardagainst betrayal from rogue Jedi.Master SifoDyaswas the only Jedi who knew of this.But with his passingwe alone know of this secretand you must keep it that way.Yes Lord Tyranus.These Jedi are a curious cult.Too spiritual for my taste.I will terminate the clone immediately.SHAAK TI The Kaminoans havesuggested that we terminate the cloneand do a rigorous molecular autopsyto discover the virus.I believe this solution is illadvised.My belief is that Tup has beenbrainwashed by the Separatistsusing some new processwe do not yet understand.BrainwashingHow could that be possibleGeneral Skywalker reportedTup missing on Ringo Vindabut after five rotationshe turned up again.That event preceded this episode.Perhaps he was compromisedat that point.We must find the truthbehind this situationor we could find many more clonesturned against us.I would like to implementa Level number  atomic brain scanto see if his thought processesare still functioning normally.And what dothe Kaminoans think of thatThey feel Tup is so weakthe Level number  atomic brain scanwould damage his neural tissueand possibly kill him.Their approachwould be to terminate himthus leaving the brainfully intact for the autopsy.Bring Clone Trooper Tupback to the Jedi Temple.Yes.

Then we can continueto the next stage of the proceedings.And what about meYou will be protected I can assure you.Master YodaWe werent expectingsuch a formal welcome Master.A personal request of the Chancellorsmy escorting you was Senator.Adventures have you hadon Scipio hmm Have you met Rush Clovis Met we have yes.Intrigued we are by your returnto Coruscant.Much distrust is focused upon you.I understand but I hope to rightthe wrongs that I have done.Delay we must not.Excuse meif I find it hard to trust you Clovis.You used to sit on this very Senateeven as you funneled creditsinto the droid foundries of Count Dooku.I understand all of your trepidation.But there is corruption in the banks.And once we find this corruptionI believe the ones responsibleshould be ousted from controlbefore the entirebanking infrastructure collapses.Oh and I supposeyoure the man to do itI only want the Banking Clanto be what it once wasa fair system of trade and commerce.I came here to root out the criminalsand reveal the truthbehind what is happening.Now now we are gratefulfor you bringing us this informationbut what exactly can you proveThese files show that huge fundshave been diverted out of the banksand into what I believeare private accounts.And the veracity of this informationI was the one who downloaded the filesfrom the Muuns secure mainframe.I believe that what Clovis is sayingis correct.Then Senator Amidala I would like youto spearhead this investigation.Work closely with Rush Clovis and findand expose these secret accounts.Once we know exactlywhat we are dealing withthen we can decidehow best to handle this situation.Why didnt you just say noSay no. WhyI dont want you working with Clovis.You dont want me working with himA serpent can shed its skinbut it is still a serpent.Well youre just going to haveto trust my judgment here.Like the last time hmmWhen you almost ended up deadOr how about you just getting arrestedand it was me who had to bail you outThe Chancellor has asked meto do this Anakin.But I am asking you to say no.As your husbandI demand that you tell the Chancelloryou are stepping down.Demand Weve been over this before.Im not foolish enough to allow myselfto be deceived twice Anakin.My sole intentions areto defend the Republic. If you cant trust me... CLOVIS CLEARS THROATUh excuse the interruption Padme.Shall we beginYes of course.General Skywalker.Darth Tyranusit is time for you once againto recruit our friend Clovis.He appears to have lost his way.And how would you like me to do thatWere going to help himtake over the Banking Clan.But first you must entrap himso he has no one else to turn to.Of course my Lord. As you wish.Ive been looking for you. Something wrong You tell me.Not that Im aware.Master Yoda feels that yourjudgmentsconcerning Rush Clovis are clouded.Hmm. I believe he cant be trusted.Yes but there is more isnt thereI sense a deep anger in youby my simply saying his name.He almost got Senator Amidala killedand I would have been responsible.The Senator has risked her lifemany times.Shes quite capableof taking care of herself.They had a relationship once.I simply feelshes vulnerable to her emotions.She is or youWhat are you implyingAnakin I understand to a degreewhat is going on.Youve met Satine. You knowI once harbored feelings for her.Its not that we are not allowedto have these feelings. Its natural.Senator Amidala and Iare simply friends.And friends you must remain.As a Jedi it is essential you makethe right choice Anakin for the Order.I understand my responsibilities.Responsibilities that must be observedwhatever relationship developsbetween Clovis and Senator Amidala.They have no relationship.It is simply business between them.Then we should haveno problems should weDOOR SLIDES OPENThe opera was wonderful butI am glad we can get down to business.If you look herethe Separatists havent been repayingany interest on their loans.But still the Banking Clan is promisingto lend credits to the Republic.Credits they simply dont have.But where have all the savings goneEach of the files that you downloadedshows hundreds and hundredsof small withdrawals.Small enough to remainundetected individuallybut as a sum total a devastating theft. BEEPINGWhoever is behind this is no fool.We need to find out whos benefiting.Were still lackinga critical piece of information.Whatever we find must remainbetween only you and I.This would behighly dangerous information should it get into the wrong hands. Of course.CHUCKLES This reminds mewhen we had three nightsto prepare for the Senate hearingto rescue Bromlarchsplanetary aqueduct system.CHUCKLES And togetherwe saved a peoplefrom total drought and famine.I dont think either of usgot any sleep that whole week.Let alone ate anything.LAUGHS Were not as youngas we used to be. CHUCKLES Were not that old either. CLEARS THROATYou might be right.Perhaps we should eat something.So Clovis why have you gottenso involved with the MuunsI believe in the banks.The system works.The Muuns arent bad people.Its just a dishonest fewwho are destroying everythingfor their own gain.You know youve never told mehow you rose to such heightswithin the Banking Clan.SIGHS Its not a happy story.My father was personal attacheto the householdof one of head Muun families.We were basically servants.I had no idea.As I grew up the head of the family tooka personal interest in my education.I was the same age as his childrenand so we all studied together.When my parents and his wifewere killed in a shuttle accidenthe adopted me. How old were you Twelve.That must have been very hard.I was accepted as their childeverywhere we went.I almost forgot where I was fromuntil I looked in the mirror. They sound like good people. They are. Most Muuns areand they want this corruption endedmore than I do.You should know my contactswithin the Muun government run deep.I have many alliesshould I need to call on them.I didnt appreciatehow personal this was for you. Now maybe you will trust me. Im here arent II want to thank youfor everything youve done for me.SIGHS I dont think I would have hadthe strength alone.Clovis dont. Its that Jedi isnt it General SkywalkerWere friends nothing more.Friends dont arguethe way I saw you arguing today.Youre confused.Isnt it forbiddenfor a Jedi to have romantic tiesHe would be banished from the Orderwould he notThere is nothing romanticbetween he and I.Then there is absolutely nothingto stop us from doing this.Clovis Clovis noGet away from herCHOKINGGROANSAnakin NoGROANSWhy dont you try fighting like a manwithout your Jedi tricksOh it would be my pleasure.GRUNTINGBoth of you stop thisYou dont have a say in thisI thought you saidhe didnt have feelings for youAhhh I see you for what you truly areGROANSYoure a serpent a traitorPlease Stop this NoIs that all you gotPANTING You should acceptthat the Senator has other interests than you.

How is he Nothing that wont heal.Im so sorry Padme. STUTTERSI dont know what came over me.Whats done is done.Its just when I saw youabout to kiss him...And I regret thatbut it was not what you thought.And you must knowI dont care for Clovis.Dont youIve told you why Im doing thisbut still you refuse to accept it. You could have killed him Anakin. I know.This marriage is not a marriage Anakinif there isnt any trust.We said at the beginningthat this could be a terrible mistake.What exactly are you sayingThat other people who are marriedhave everything that we donteverything that we wont.We live in secret Anakin.Like it or not our relationship is builton lies and deception.No relationship can survive that.I know I went too far. Its just... SIGHSIts just something inside me snapped.I dont know whos in there sometimes.I just know that Im not happy anymore.I dont feel safe.But Padme...I think its bestif we dont see each other anymore.At least not for a while.Im sorry Anakin.Um...Im sorry too.Everything all right SenatorNo.TWILIGHT ENGINE STARTINGWHIRRINGNothing appears to be broken.But more importantlysomeone wants to speak with you.What are you talking aboutI am a servant of Count Dooku. Hello Clovis. What do you want DookuIt appears we have a mutual problemthat I would like to fix.I know the Separatists have not beenrepaying their loans to the banks.Now why would wesupport corruptionYou expect me to believethat Lesser and his associateshave no ties with youTheyve allowed you to borrow creditsand not pay any interest.What you say is correctbut that information if made publicwill only bring war to Scipioand the banks will fall.Nobody wants that.So in the interests of allI suggest we cometo some arrangement.What are you sayingThat the banks neednew managementand that it could be you.That I would like help.If I didnt know betterId say you were afraid.I prefer the term careful.These are delicate matters.We need funds just as the Republicdoes to pay for this war.I can give you the locationof the secret accountsyou are searching forso you can plead your caseto the Senate.And you wont stand in my wayWell even start paying the intereston our loansto show the Republicour full endorsement.What do you get out of thisStability in unstable times.The location of the accountsare on this disk.Now where were weThe Muun governmenthas seized the accountsand arrested the headsof the Banking Clan.We are indebted to Rush Clovisfor his service to our people.Well I have doneonly what I thought was right.Considering the informationit appears that the Separatistgovernment has agreedto allow youto be the new head of the banks.

The lightsaber of SifoDyas it is.Never found when he died it was.Master Kenobi remind the Councilof what you discoveredregarding Master SifoDyas beforethe start of the Clone War.My investigation of the bounty hunterJango Fett led to Kamino.The Kaminoans recountedthat it was Jedi Master SifoDyaswho ordered the productionof a Clone Army.Without the consent of the Councilor the Senate he did this.Prior to the blockade of NabooSifoDyas sat on this Council untilwe judged his ideas to be too extreme.PLO Indeed.He said he foresaw a great conflictand that the Republic would needto raise an army.At the time the Councilrejected those ideas.Well its not the first timeweve been wrong recently is itThe creation of the Clone Armykept secret from us SifoDyas did.How this was done we know not.Yet now a new pieceof the puzzle we haveperhaps clarity it will bring us yes.Our records definitively statethat Master SifoDyas died on Felucia.In the fifth quarter a small skirmishbroke out between the native Felucians.Master SifoDyas was assignedto negotiate peace talksbetween the tribes.The negotiations failedand SifoDyas was killed.What became of his bodyI am afraid I cannot answer that.Any further information on this incidenthas been sealed.On whose authorityBy the officeof the Supreme Chancellor.Thank you Madame Jocasta.To FeluciaSkywalker and Kenobi will go.A trail long cold it is yet stilllay hidden there a clue might be.Question all who were present the dayof SifoDyass death you must.And what of the sealed fileSpeak with the Chancellorpersonally I willto see what part in this the politicsof the Senate have played.Master SifoDyasForgive me Im afraid I am not familiarwith that name.Died some time ago he did on Felucia.Investigating his death we areand yet sealed by the Chancellorsoffice some of his files were.And what is the natureof your investigationA Jedi matter it is Chancellor.Add to your troubles I would not.That is very considerate Master Yoda.May I at least ask when Master...SifoDyas.Yes Master SifoDyasmay I ask when he was killedOver number number  years ago it was.Well that explains it.Im afraid this was before my time.Ten years ago I was a humble Senatorserving the planet Naboo.Only my predecessorChancellor Valorumwould have the answers you seek.I suggest you speak with him.Very well. Thank you Chancellor.DEVICE BEEPINGI have spoken withthe tribal leaders on Felucia.They use a very ancient dialectwhich is hard to understandbut from what I can make outwhen Master SifoDyas diedhe was not alone.There was a second Jedihere with him.And the name of this second JediEither I dont understand themor they wont say. Its hard to tell.This is a primitive peoplewe are dealing with.After his deaththey cremated SifoDyass bodyand Im afraid the trail goes cold there.Did you have any successwith the ChancellorSIGHS As much success as usualI am afraid.Pointed in another direction I am nowto speak with Valorum I go.Its been a long time my friend.What can I do for youA file sealed by your administrationthe Jedi Council has come across.The subject of the fileJedi Master SifoDyas.SifoDyasWhen I was ChancellorI sent him on a mission to dealwith a flare up in the Pyke syndicate.The PykesA powerful part of the spice cartel.Their criminal activitieshad allowed themto almost completely controlthe production of raw spiceused to create a powerful drug.We were facing a full scale warunderneath the surface of Coruscant.Knowing of his expertiseon the UnderworldI contacted Master SifoDyasto stabilize the problem.Know of this the Jedi Council did not.The Senate Committeeassigned to the matterfeared that open discussionswith such a criminal elementcould legitimize their activitiesand give strength to opposition leaderswithin the bureaucracy.Secrecy was our only choice.The timing of these negotiationswhen were they to take placeI cannot remember the precise timingIm afraid. It was so long ago.I do remember thatthe talks were postponednot long after our delegatesarrived on Oba Diah.Something about a flare upof activity on Felucia.Yes intervene on Feluciathe Council insisted SifoDyas didbut tell me Chancellor who wasthe other Jedi you sent with SifoDyasOther Jedi I know of no other Jedi.There was only my personal aideSilman and SifoDyas.Im afraid they wereboth killed on Felucia.Personal aid SilmanTell me why do the Jedilook for SifoDyasWhat trail are they followingIf there is a trail it is unknown to me.Retrace your stepsfind this loose end and eliminate it.I understand what is at stake my Lord.I will go to the Pykes and take care of it.This is not the first time you haveproven to be clumsy Lord Tyranus. GASPING You know the price of failure.COUGHINGThe Felucians knownothing of this Silman.No one there seemsto know anything about him.Whats that symbol hes wearingThe symbol of the high Chancellorbefore the war Chancellor Valorum.So we have one dead Jedi withno physical evidence of a bodya second Jedi who appearedon Felucia that we have no record ofand now this Silman personal attacheto the Chancellor is missingYet now we know SifoDyasand Silman were both on Oba Diahaccording to Chancellor Valorum.The crashed shuttle I found was locatedon a moon which orbits the Pyke planet.Hmm.

We all sensed it.For something to affect Yodathis deeply concerns me.We must keep an eye on our old friend.The war has taxed all of us to our limit.I suppose were just surprisedthat Master Yoda has one.I hope its that simple.But I feel the shadow of somethinggreater on our horizon.QUIGON Yoda.Oh Master Yoda.Sorry I didnt see you there.Is everything okayEncountered something difficult I have.Difficult For you MasterSpoke with Master QuiGon Jinnon Mortis did you notSIGHING Yes so did ObiWan.However since hes deadwe dont think it was actually him.Rather an illusion.

Rest I must.We have to consider thatthis may be a deception by the Sith.Surely you are not suggesting.Master Yoda is susceptibleto such manipulationMaster Yoda you are olderand wiser than any living Jedibut this does not mean you are beyondthe corruption of the dark side.Agree I do.A possibility we must consider it is.Clouded so much of our visionthe dark side has.Deceived I may be.All I can tell you isI have scanned Master Yoda three timesand I find nothing wrong with him.I am not an expert on his biologybut from my point of viewhe is in perfect health.And his mindNo signs of any degeneration.This section of the brainis particularly active.More than I have seen in any other Jedi.Probably what happens whenyou approach number number number  years old.I think we are overlookingan obvious thread.Which isCount Dooku was Yodas apprentice.And Count Dookuhas fallen to the dark side.All of us have apprenticedto Master Yoda.He cannot be held accountablefor Dookus descent.But they are connected. Profoundly.Whoever the Sith Lord ishe may be using this relationshipas a direct link to Yoda.Impossible.Are you so sureIf the Sith Lord wanted toattack the Jedi Order from withinMaster Yoda would bethe perfect choice.I fear we aremore vulnerable than we think.I would like to suggest something.A deprivation ritual.It is a dangerous procedurebut one that will without questionallow Yoda to go tothe source of this voice.Whatever whoever it may be.I am sorry to bother youbut the Chancellors requestingthat Master Yoda attendan emergency meeting.I will go.What about the treatmentAsk Master Yoda what he wants to do.Only he can decide now.The chamber works todeprive the patientof any stimulation except from within.Master Yoda will be taken intoan induced meditation.This allows the patient to go deeperthan anything we can achieveby ourselves.Master Yoda you dont have to do this.Solve this puzzle I will.But it could bemore dangerous than you realize.The danger is not to know the truth.See clearly I must.Help this will.Life signs are normal.Beginning the procedure.HEART BEATINGHEART BEATING CONTINUESWhat are you doingBy reducing the flow of oxygenthe body will be forcedinto a deep meditative state.It will take himas close to death as possible.I dont like this.QUIGON Yoda no.This is not the way.Come to Dagobah.The answers you seek are here.But whyYou must complete what I could not.His vital signs are dropping too low.

What is it I think Echos alive.Thats not possible.He died at the Citadel.The way the droids are countering us herethe strategies Im usingtheyre all old battle plansEcho and I drew up together.Look Rex I hear what youre saying.But its just not possible.I hope youre right.But the fact is Echosfingerprints are all over these Separatist strategies.

Why not We have to make it appearas if your signalis originating from Skako Minor.Otherwise theyll know we are here.My name is General Mace Winduof the Jedi Order.At this point of the Clone WarI have dismantled and destroyed overnumber number number number number number  of you type one battle droids.Im giving you an opportunityto peacefully lay down your weaponsso that you may be reprogrammedto serve a better purposethan spreading the mindlessviolence and chaoswhich you have inflicted upon the galaxy.Blast themWell I guess it was worth a try.Heres the new strategy from SkakoAdmiral.Mobilize all troops on Anaxesto the assembly complex.The Republic will not send reinforcements.They will put all their faith in the Jedi.Give the order.Im intercepting a transmission.Trench is ordering all of his droidsto the assembly complex.All right Echowhat are you trying to pullDont worry thats what I told him to do.But our troops will be vastly outnumbered.Not when I send them a feedback pulsethat shuts down all the droids.How do we knowthats what youre really going to doWe have to trust him.Rex is right.Echo were all counting on you.Master Windu I know this sounds crazybut its about to geta little more crowded where you are.We have our hands full as it is.What is your planWell if it makes you feel any betterit isnt my plan.Echo is drawing all the droidsto your positionso he can neutralize them allat the same time.ObiWanSkywalker just contacted me.He said weve got a lot more droidsheaded our way.I see Anakin is being as insightfulas ever.I was told not to worry.It was all part of their plan.If I know Anakin weve got the easy part.The droidsare going to overwhelm the Jedi.They dont stand a chance.Well there werent as manyas I thought there were going to be.Does this meet your expectationsThis exceeds my expectations.HeyShutting down.Awaiting orders.WhatWhat was thatWe monitored a powerful energy surgewhich has overloadedthe droids circuitry.We are tracking the originof this pulse now.I am pleased to report that we arein control of the assembly complexand all of the fronts are fallingto the Republic thanks to Echos plan.Thats good news Master Windu.Were on our way back to the base.May the Force be with you.Good job Echo.Well I guess you actually areon our side.Was there ever any doubtSome.Well thanks.Come on brother.Unplug and lets get out of here.The algorithm has never been wrong before.How could we have missed thisThe source originated onboard this ship.Dispatch security droids.What about our apparent defeatA wise leader does not rely completelyon things such as algorithms.My personal strategy for victoryis through total annihilation.WaitI just scanned a new order from Trench.Hes initiated a countdown.Theres a bomb hiddenat the assembly complexbut its big enoughto destroy most of Anaxes.Can you stop itWell I can try.General where are you goingIf you cant stop the detonationperhaps Trench can Continue your sweep Jesse. Sir.General Windu this is Tech.Weve discovered a bombin the fusion reactor.We need someone to go down thereand help disarm it.Im on my way.Get the men out of here.You heard General Windu.Organize your platoons and have themevacuate as soon as possible.Sir yes sirRay shield.Echo I found the bomb.Tell me the sequence to shut it down.Im decrypting it now.You have to unplug.Theyre going to detect us.No no we need these codes.The first number in the sequence is three.The next is... one.Eight.We have located the source of the pulse.Seven.Jam the signal at its source.Theyre on to us.You need to unplug nowEchoThe server overloaded his neural systemand it appears deliberate. Echo That means Trench knows were here.Echo are you thereGeneral Windu Trench took out Echo.We cant get you the last numberin the sequence.Sorry General youll haveto disarm that bomb without us.Dont worry about me Captain.Just get your men out of there.Yes sir.We got companyThe Jedi lacks the final sequencesto stop the detonation.The loss of clones at the shipyardwill seal the Republics fate.Dispatch more unitsto deal with the infiltrators on the shipand prepare our landing craftfor our next assault.As you command.HuhJedi scum.Tell me the sequence to disarm the bombNever.Dooku would kill me for losing Anaxes.And you think I wontYoure a Jedi.Your nobility...I dont have such weaknessesNow lets try that again.Mace if you cant stop the detonationyou must leave now.That is not an option.I still have a chance to stop thiseven if its down to my best guess.How about I takethe guesswork out of it MasterAdmiral Trench was kind enoughto give me the final number himself.Try seven.Good work Skywalker.The bomb has been disarmed.You both owe me one now.Wreckers gonna love this.Admiral it was a pleasure.Hey FireWe cant blast our way out.Theres too many of them.Whats he doingTime to releasethe wrecking ballYeahHeyI honestly feel badfor those droids.Its all clearPlease not the face.Not the faceMore droids.Go.

As always.Thats what friends are for.If youre going to face Maulyoull need these.I took care of them. Theyre good as new.Maybe a little better.You capture Maul.Ill take care of Grievous.With any luck this will all be over soon.Master Kenobi always saidtheres no such thing as luck.Good thing I taught you otherwise.AnakinGood luck.Commander I have Prime MinisterAlmec of Mandalore on the comm.Put him through.What is the meaning of this invasionThe Republic presence hereis a direct violation of our treaty.Your time has come Almec.We know youre Mauls puppetand we are coming for him.Ahha Mistress BoKatan the traitor.I should have knownyou were behind this incursion.Siding with the Republic will make youan enemy in the eyes of the people.Im fine with that.Youre nothing like your sister.Saxonprepare our forces for an allout attack.Rookinform the syndicate of the invasion.Its been a whilesince we had a fight like this.Are you readyUrsacan you confirm the targets locationI can only confirmthat Maul has not left the city.All other attempts to locate himhave been blocked.Saxon is already scrambling his defenses.Weve got incomingWhat are you waiting for Get out thereSorryI didnt think to bring you a jetpack.Dont need one.Race you to the surface.Thanks CommanderBeat you.Some things never change.Were meeting stronger oppositionthan anticipated.Theyve already taken the docksand are moving on your position.Escape to the Undercity.You will be met there.Understood.No sign of Maul yet.We cant sustain a long siege.Ill head for the throne roomand deal with Almec.You must find Maul.I want you to support Ursa at the docks.We must ensure Maul doesnt escape.If hes here.If hes not then all of thisplays right into his hands.Commander Rex this is CTnumber number number number .I think we have something.Ill be right there Captain.Captain Vaughn what have you gotWe were cutting off this access pointto the Undercitywhen we engaged one of the leadershipGar Saxon.He disappeared through there.Seemed in a hurry.Whats down thereA system of tunnels sewage ports mainly.Some conduit access pipes.Do they lead outside the cityUnknown sir.Lets move in.The Jedi was sightedentering the lower city.Then its just as our lord predicted.Wheres MaulYou were never the politicianyour sister was.He wanted you to bring the Jedi herebut you brought the wrong one.Ahsoka come in.Youre walking into a trap.AhsokaGet down.Vaughn waitLook outThis way Hurry.Watch it Watch itStop.
